## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WE DO A REWRITE ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Go visit [https://codeberg.org/thefederationinfo/next](https://codeberg.org/thefederationinfo/next) to track the progress.

## How to get your platform listed

Just implement the .well-known [NodeInfo](http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/) endpoint to your project.

Matrix instances are scraped with a dedicated scraper since they don't (yet) provide generic metadata.

### OK, I've done that, what now?

Register your node here, for example `https://the-federation.info/register/mynode.tld`. If it is a success, you're good! If your platform is new, or you want to update an existing platform information, raise an issue providing the following:

* URL to code
* Description
* Display name
* Code license
* Icon
* URL to install guide
* Tagline
* URL to official website

If it's closed source, leave out link to code and install guide. Icon can be any size, currently only using 16px. Possibly will have a larger image at some point on the platform page. Tagline is a kind of short one sentence marketing line, see other platforms.

### Code of Conduct

While interactions on our site is not possible, we expect sites we list to have a humane code of conduct in place. Should sites who fail to ban content that can be found generally harmful, that node will be blocked from listing here.

Harmful content can be, but not limited to, malware, graphical material of minorities, abusive images, hateful content, racist content and climate denialism. The admins of this site reserve the right to decide case by case on blocking of nodes. Please report any nodes violating our terms to the admins.
